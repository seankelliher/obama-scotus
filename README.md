## Reflection

I set out to build a component that lets users learn about Barack Obama's history with Supreme Court nominees. Before designing and coding, I needed to gather information, write accurate descriptions, and find photographs that I could legally use. Once building, technical challenges included deciding how much animation to use (less turned out to be more) and keeping images stationary when the amount of accompanying text differed with each scene.
