## Reflection

I wanted to build a component that lets users learn about Barack Obama's history with Supreme Court nominees. Before coding, I needed to gather information, write accurate descriptions, and find photographs that I could legally use. I initially planned on using a lot of CSS animation. This did not work very well. The transformations looked tacky. Fading in only the play and re-play icons worked best. Other challenges were keeping the "scenes" in the gallery a uniform height as some had more text to display than others.
